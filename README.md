# ytmp3-2

## Setup

Remember to have [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) installed
on your machine. If you don't just `npm install -g angular-cli`

Then in the cloned project folder remember to `npm install`

Once that is done you can `ng serve` to serve the angular app via dev or you can
`ng build` to build the project.

Sepparately remember to start the server. At the moment you have to run `node server.js`.

## Purpose

This is a small app used to download youtube videos as mp3 files.
It uses angular2, nodejs and ffmpeg as well as a tonne of other modules and libraries.

## Planned features
* support for downloading entire playlists
* some serious backend refactoring and cleanup
* serving the angular app from the server (this will allow me to put it on heroku or something)

> Remember, Google says it's illegal to use the app, not to create it. So use it at your own risk!
